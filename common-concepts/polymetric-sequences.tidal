-- Creating polymetric sequences is a fairly advanced thing you can 
-- do using the Tidal mini-notation. To do so, enclose your pattern
-- between curly brackets ({}):
d1 $ s "{bd*2, hh*4, bd hh 808:4}%8"

-- Alternatively, you can also add the precise subdivision you
-- are looking for by using % followed by the subdivision number:
d1 $ s "{bd hh 808:4}%8"

d2 $ s "{bd cp 808:5}%4" # speed 2
