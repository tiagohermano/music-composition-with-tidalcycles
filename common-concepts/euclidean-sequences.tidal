-- Euclidian rhythms are rhythms obtained using the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
-- They were described in 2004 by Godfried Toussaint, a canadian computer scientist.
-- Euclidian rhythms are really useful for computer/algorithmic music because they can 
-- accurately describe a large number of rhythms used in the most important music world traditions.
-- The algorithm work by providing two numbers:
-- -> the number of beats
-- -> the number of steps/silences to fill

-- An euclidian rhythm will distribute the first number of beats to the second numbers of steps 
-- to be filled. With Tidal, you can create euclidian rhythms by adding an event followed by 
-- the (x,y) indicator, x and y corresponding to the numbers described above:
d1 $ s "bass:3(7,16)"

d1 $ s "[bd(3,8), cp(2,8), hh(7,8), bass:1(7,16)]"

d1 $ s "[bd(5,8), cp(4,8), hh(7,8), bass:1(7,16)]"

d1 $ s "[bd(5,8), cp(1,8)?, hh(7,8), bass:1(8,16)]"
