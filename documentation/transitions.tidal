-- Transitions are functions you can use to switch musically
-- between patterns. Start with a pattern on d1:
d1 $ s "bd(3,8) drum*4"

-- You can then perform a crossfade transition to a new pattern using xfade:
xfade 1 $ s "arpy*8" # n (run 8)
-- Note that the argument we give to xfade is 1, which means to apply 
-- the transition to the pattern that is running on d1.

-- You can use transitions on any d pattern in Tidal:
d3 $ s "bd(3,8)"

xfade 3 $ s "arpy*4"


-- You can also apply a transition to any arbitrary pattern name:
p "drums" $ s "bd(3,8) drum*4"

xfade "drums" $ s "arpy*8" # n (run 8)

-- Most of the transitions also have an "In" variant, where you can
-- specify the number of cycles that the transition takes to complete:
d1 $ s "bd(3,8) drum*4"

xfadeIn 1 8 $ s "arpy*8" # n (run 8)
